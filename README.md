This repository showcases two CNC machining projects completed as part of my Master of Engineering (Machining Support System module). Both projects focus on advanced CAM simulation, CNC programming, and machining process optimization using Autodesk PowerMill and 5-axis CNC machines.
🚀 Projects Overview
🔹 1. CAM Design of SD-6 Front Bulkhead
A precision aerospace component designed for Jennings Aerospace, simulated and programmed in Autodesk PowerMill for the MAZAK Variaxis i-600 5-axis CNC machine.
Highlights:
·	Toolpath design and optimization for roughing, semi-finishing, and finishing.
·	Integration of SECO Tools Ltd. and Sandvik Coromant tooling data.
·	Achieved high-precision machining with efficient material removal.
·	Addressed tool accessibility and collision avoidance in complex geometries.
🔹 2. Machining and SPC Analysis of a Watch Body
A collaborative project involving CNC manufacturing and statistical process control (SPC) of a precision watch case using a Matsuura LX-1 CNC machine.
Highlights:
·	Developed roughing and finishing strategies using PowerMill.
·	Generated and validated NC code for machining.
·	Conducted dimensional accuracy verification using Mitutoyo CMM.
·	Applied control charts and Cp/Cpk analysis to assess process capability.
